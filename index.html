    <p><strong>PROJECT TRACKER SOFTWARE:</strong></p>
    <p>Project management is the process of planning, organizing, and controlling resources to achieve
        specific goals and objectives. It involves creating a project plan, setting goals and milestones,
        and tracking progress to ensure that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the
        satisfaction of all stakeholders. A project tracker is a tool that can be used to monitor and
        manage the progress of a project. It typically includes features such as task assignments,
        progress updates, timelines, and budget tracking. A project tracker can be used to identify areas
        of the project that are behind schedule or over budget, and to make adjustments as necessary
        to ensure that the project stays on track<br></p>
